"hol" directory contains the hands on lab, the needed libraries and the presentation
"src" contains the final solution described in the "hol"
"lib" contains the libraries used in the final solution
"db"  contains the stored procedures discussed in the presentation

If you want to test the solution without having followed the "hol", you need to
create an empty database "MovieStore". Change the connectionstring in the config file of
the MovieStore.App project (if needed).
